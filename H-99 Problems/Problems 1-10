Problem 1
(*) Find the last element of a list.

(Note that the Lisp transcription of this problem is incorrect.)

Example in Haskell:

λ> myLast [1,2,3,4]
4
λ> myLast ['x','y','z']
'z'

Problem 2
(*) Find the last but one element of a list.

(Note that the Lisp transcription of this problem is incorrect.)

Example in Haskell:

λ> myButLast [1,2,3,4]
3
λ> myButLast ['a'..'z']
'y'
"""

myButLast xs = if length (xs) > 2 then myButLast (tail xs) else head xs -- Assumes list is of at least length 2

"""
Problem 3
(*) Find the K'th element of a list. The first element in the list is number 1.

Example:

* (element-at '(a b c d e) 3)

Example in Haskell:

λ> elementAt [1,2,3] 2
